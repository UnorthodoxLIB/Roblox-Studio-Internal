Contributions primarily should consist of:

Compatibility Specific Structures -- > Slight changes and whatnot.
Abstractions (ease of use) -- > This will be judged harshley, and any "significant" overhead will be ignored.
Updating Signatures -- > Signatures change, and I (UnorthodoxLIB) wont always fix it too quickly.
