Roblox Studio Patcher.

This simply clones roblox studio, & creates a new one named "RobloxStudioInternal.exe" of which has Internal patched.

In order to use the Executable, simply drag any version of it into the same directory as RobloxStudioBeta.exe & run said executable, this should start the process I explained just before this.

This isn't a virus, it's quite literally 9.5kb, & 30 lines long.
I'm pretty sure Winsock would make this use more than 9.5kb.


Plans
-->
Create "Auto updating" library for patcher, so it's easy to integrate with other software.
Create "Patch detection" for the patcher to check if the patches are out of date, & shouldn't run.
Create custom launcher for Roblox Studio Internal, for QoL.
