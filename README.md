Roblox Studio Patcher 1.0.5 --> CURRENT VER

Various compilations, including that of a library.
Auto updating for "smartpatcher"
Created C library, "patcherlib.h"
Can both be included as a .lib, .dll, or directly.

Roblox Studio Patcher 1.0.6 --> Moving here, not completed yet.

Added QoL to smartpatcher, with links to github if an error occurs.
Added license output to smartpatcher.
Added some basic error-tracking to smartpatcher.
Made smartpatcher include Curl internally.
Overhauled the github contents, & swapped to LLVM over MSVC.

Plans
-->
Create "Auto updating" library for patcher, so it's easy to integrate with other software. (DONE!)
Create "Patch detection" for the patcher to check if the patches are out of date, & shouldn't run. (TODO!)
Create custom launcher for Roblox Studio Internal, for QoL. (TODO!)
